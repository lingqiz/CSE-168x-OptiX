In order to compile the samples in the SDK you need the following:

0. An NVIDIA graphics card with R435.80 driver or newer. It doesn't have to be
   an RTX card. If you don't know the version of the driver, just upgrade it 
   to the newest version. 

1. CUDA Toolkit 5.0+ (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Install the 
   latest version if you don't have CUDA yet.

2. CMake 3.0 minimum and GNU make. *

3. C++ compiler (gcc 4.4 and 4.8 been tested). *

4. OptiX 6.5.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download).

* You can install them using a package management system on Linux.

Instructions for building:

1. Install OpenGL and FreeGLUT if you haven't. On Debian or distributions 
   that are based on Debian (like Ubuntu), you can install OpenGL and 
   FreeGlut using the command
     $ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev

2. Create a directory called "build" under the current directory.

3. Run
     $ cmake -S . -B build -D OptiX_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=<path>
   where <path> is the installation path of OptiX, for instance, 
   /usr/local/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-6.5.0-linux64.

4. Run
     $ cmake --build build
   to build.

5. You can find the executable, called OptiXRenderer, in the bin directory under 
   your build directory. To run the program, you can run
     $ <path to the executable> <path to the scene file>
   For instance, if you are at the top-most directory, which is the parent 
   directory of the build directory, you can run
     $ build/bin/OptiXRenderer Scenes/hw1/scene1.test 

6. When you run it, it should spawn a new window which serves as an image viewer. 
   When you close the viewer, the generated image will be automatically saved to 
   the working directory (the one you are currently in).

7. After you create new source files, remember to add them to 
   OptiXRenderer/CMakeLists.txt.
